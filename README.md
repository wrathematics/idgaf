# idgaf


#### What is this?

This R package contains all public GitHub commits containing the word
"fuck" in the commit message, from 3/11/2012 to 7/24/2014.


#### How do I install it?

To install the package from github, I recommend using Hadley 
Wickham's devtools package, which you can get from the CRAN.  After
installing that, you can enter

````
library(devtools)
install_github(repo="idgaf", username="wrathematics")
```
`
into an R terminal to install this package.  You can also install 
the package a simple via:

````
R CMD INSTALL idgaf_1.0.tar.gz
```
